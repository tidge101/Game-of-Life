This is an implementation of Conway's Game of Life, a simulation of cells created by the mathematician John Conway. I created this for my Data Structures and Algorithms class in the fall of 2016 at Chapman University.

Reused code from Assignment 1 to write to file

Issues:
I can’t figure out why but Doughnut mode and Mirror mode inconsistently give seg fault errors. I can run it on the same input file and it’ll only seg fault sometimes. I’ve gone through the relevant code and made some changes and it looks like it should work. I can’t really be sure because of the infrequent nature though.¯\_(ツ)_/¯ EDIT: After further changes I’m like 99% sure this is fixed.

Other notes:
My solution consists of a Grid class and a main function.

To compile: Simply type make in command line

When file output is specified, output is written to dillontidgewell.out
